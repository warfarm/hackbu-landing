 * <picture>, its campus <img>, the twelve cloud cutouts — is in the HTML
 * response and the preload scanner can act on the elements themselves rather
 * than only on the hint in the <head> (P5-1, and P5-8 with it). Hydrating
 * adopts that markup instead of replacing it; `createRoot().render()` would
 * throw the server's DOM away and reintroduce the blank first paint the
 * prerender exists to remove.
 *
 * The tree above must therefore match `src/entry-server.tsx`'s `renderIndex()`
 * exactly,
 * <StrictMode> included, and nothing in it may read the browser during render
 * — see the note on `usePrefersReducedMotion()` in src/lib/motion.ts, which is
 * the one place that wanted to.
 *
 * The dev server is the exception, and it is not a compromise: `vite dev`
 * serves the *source* `index.html`, whose root div is empty, and hydrating an
 * empty root div is itself a mismatch — React 19 throws
 * "Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client"
 * and re-renders the whole tree, which would put a permanent error in the
 * console of every dev session. `import.meta.env.DEV` is a compile-time
 * constant, so the production bundle keeps only the `hydrateRoot` branch and
 * the check costs nothing shipped.
