/**
 * Page shell.
 *
 * Order is: fixed header -> the hero's scroll track (with the page <h1>) ->
 * content sections on cloud, separated by snowdrift dividers -> footer on frost.
 *
 * The hero is the only element the scroll work touches; see
 * src/components/Hero.tsx for its layer contract.
 *
 * The whole tree sits inside one <LazyMotion features={domAnimation} strict>.
 * `motion.*` components carry motion's *whole* feature set with them — drag,
 * pan and layout projection included — which is ~50 KB of the shared chunk this
 * page uses none of: there is no drag, no `layout`/`layoutId`, no
 * <AnimatePresence> anywhere in `src/`. The `m.*` components carry no features
 * at all and take them from this provider instead, and `domAnimation` is
 * exactly animations + gestures — which is where `whileInView` lives, so the
 * section reveals still work. `strict` makes the saving enforceable rather than
 * conventional: rendering a `motion.*` component below this point throws, so
 * the full bundle cannot creep back in one component at a time. See P5-2.

         * that — which would paint the UA's default ring around the entire page
         * content. Nothing else on the page suppresses an outline, and the two
         * elements this appears on carry no other focus treatment to lose.
