import { BEARCAT_MARK, WORDMARK_MARK } from '../lib/images'

/**
 * The HackBU logo lockup: the bearcat mark beside the HACKBU wordmark.
 *
 * Both marks are **masked elements, not images**. Each `<span>` is painted in
 * the `fern` token and has its shape cut out of it by a mask derivative from
 * `public/brand/` — see the `.brand-mark-*` rules in src/index.css for why, and
 * `scripts/generate-images.mjs` for how the derivatives are made. The upshot
 * here is that the two source marks, which ship in two different greens, come
 * out of this component in one.
 *
 * **Sizing.** The marks are sized in `em`, so the lockup scales with its own
 * font-size and the call sites keep setting the size the way they did when this
 * was literal text — `text-2xl` in the footer, `text-2xl sm:text-3xl` in the
 * header. Widths come from `aspect-ratio` against the trimmed ink boxes, so
 * neither mark can be stretched by a stray width.
 *
 * At the two sizes actually used:
 *
 *     text-2xl (16px em -> 24px)   bearcat 30.0 x 28.6   wordmark 17.3 x 123.0
 *     text-3xl (          30px)    bearcat 37.5 x 35.7   wordmark 21.6 x 153.8
 *
 * The taller of those, 37.5px, sits inside the `sm` header's 80px bar with room
 * to spare, and the whole `sm` lockup is 199px wide.
 *
 * **Accessibility.** The two marks are one logo, not two graphics: the wrapper
 * carries `role="img"` with an "HackBU" label, which makes the children
 * presentational, so a screen reader announces the lockup once, as the club's
 * name. In the header that label is also what names the link wrapping it, which
 * would otherwise have no accessible name at all — the marks are empty
 * elements with no text to fall back on.
 *
 * That wrapper is the one lint suppression in `src/`. `jsx-a11y`'s
 * `prefer-tag-over-role` reads `role="img"` and asks for an `<img>` element
 * instead, which cannot express this: there is no single image file to point
 * at, only two masked elements that have to be announced as one graphic —
 * exactly the case WAI-ARIA's `img` role exists for. Rewriting it as an `<img>`
 * would mean shipping a third, pre-coloured logo file and giving up the
 * one-token recolouring described above, so the rule is switched off for this
 * attribute only and stays on everywhere else.
