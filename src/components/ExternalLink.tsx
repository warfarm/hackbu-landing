 * Every text link on the page uses one of the two strings below, picked by the
 * surface it sits on. They exist so the surface rule is structural rather than
 * a convention four separate class-strings each had to remember:
 *
 *   **cloud** (`#F7F5EE`) — hover recolours to `brick`, which measures 4.78:1
 *   there and clears AA.
 *   **frost** (`#DCE3EA`) — hover underlines instead. `brick` on frost measures
 *   **4.03:1** and fails AA, so it must never be the hover on this surface;
 *   thickening an underline signals the same thing and costs no contrast.
 *
 * Pick by the background the link is actually painted on, not by the component
 * it lives in: the header and the content sections are cloud, the footer and
 * the get-involved card are frost. Both strings carry the page's one focus
 * ring — pine, offset 4 — which reads at 6.83:1 on cloud and 5.76:1 on frost,
 * so it needs no per-surface variant.
 *
 * Typography is deliberately *not* here. A link's size, weight and resting
 * underline belong to its context; what these fix is only the part that has a
 * contrast answer.

/**
 * Every off-site link on the page goes through here so the new-tab + rel
 * hardening can never be forgotten. mailto: links use MailLink instead — a
 * mail client should not open in a throwaway browser tab.
 *
 * Two behaviours, picked by `isSameSite(href)` and by nothing else:
 *
 *   **hackbu.org** — navigates in place. No `target`, no notice. Eight footer
 *   pages, nav destinations and the mailing-list form are all the club's own
 *   site; a new tab for them buys nothing and leaves the reader with a pile of
 *   windows onto one site (P4-1).
 *
 *   **everything else** — keeps `target="_blank"` with the `rel` hardening,
 *   and now says so. WCAG technique G201 asks that a new window be announced
 *   in advance; the visually-hidden span does that for a screen-reader or
 *   magnifier user, and appends to the link's accessible name ("Discord, opens
 *   in a new tab") rather than replacing it, so the visible text and the
 *   announced text still match (2.5.3 Label in Name).
 *
 * `{...rest}` stays first so a caller cannot overwrite `href`, `target` or
 * `rel` — the hardening is not overridable by a prop, which is the point of
 * routing every link through one component.
