/**
 * The hero's drifting cloud parallax.
 *
 * This component *is* the `data-hero-clouds` layer of the hero stage: it mounts
 * over the campus artwork and is the topmost layer of it (see Hero.tsx for the
 * layer contract), rendering three depth layers of cloud cutouts over the sky.
 * There is nothing above it — the pine legibility scrim that used to sit there
 * went when the hero copy moved out to <AboutSection>.
 *
 * Two independent motions compose here, and they are deliberately kept on
 * separate elements so they never fight over one transform:
 *
 *   [data-cloud-layer]   scroll-linked. translateY + opacity, driven by the
 *                        hero's scroll progress. This is the layer that lifts
 *                        the clouds out of frame and fades them before the pan
 *                        uncovers the campus.
 *     [data-cloud-drift] time-linked. translateX only, linear, and looping for
 *                        as long as the layer above it is visible — it stops
 *                        once that layer's fade has reached zero and starts
 *                        again if the reader scrolls back. See `CloudLayer`.
 *       [CloudSet] xN    the repeated tiles that make the drift seamless.
 *
 * Only `transform` and `opacity` are ever animated. There is no scroll event
 * listener anywhere — the scroll-linked half reads `useHeroScroll()`, which is
 * fed by the single `useScroll` subscription <Hero> already owns.

   * These are derived from `scale`, not chosen: parallax reads as depth only

 *
 * The casting is a sort on **intrinsic height**, not width, because height is
 * what reads as scale for clouds sitting in a horizontal sky band. Sorting on
 * height happens to separate the layers in *both* dimensions, which a
 * width-based sort does not — at and above `REFERENCE_WIDTH` the rendered
 * boxes are:
 *
 *     far    123-160 px wide    38-92 px tall
 *     mid    210-344 px wide   136-183 px tall
 *     near   359-493 px wide   291-348 px tall
 *
 * so no cloud in a nearer layer is ever drawn smaller than one in a more
 * distant layer, on either axis. (The tightest margin is width, 344 -> 359
 * across the mid/near boundary; the height margins are 44px and 108px.)
 *
 * The sort also lands where shape says it should. `far` gets the flat wisps —
 * cloud-6 at 3.20:1, cloud-12 at 2.45:1, cloud-4 at 2.46:1, cloud-10 at
 * 1.74:1 — which is what distant cloud reads as. `near` gets the tall cumulus
 * towers: cloud-11 at 1.13:1, cloud-8 at 1.06:1, cloud-5 at 1.36:1, cloud-1 at
 * 1.66:1. `mid` takes the four in between.
 *
 * `scale`, `opacity` and speed all rise together toward the viewer, and speed
 * is derived from `scale` rather than picked — see `driftSeconds` above.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why all three layers still render at every viewport
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Whether small screens should drop a layer was measured, at six clouds, and
 * answered no. Twelve clouds doubles the mounted node count and the layer
 * coverage, so the measurement below is retaken at twelve rather than
 * inherited from that answer.
 *
 * At 390x844, with `SET_COUNT` = 4, **48 `<img>` nodes are mounted and 16 of
 * them intersect the stage box** — the other 32 are tiles the stage clips
 * whole, so they cost layout, not paint. (At 1440x900 it is 14 of 48.) The 16
 * that do paint cover 66.4% of one stage in bounding boxes; weighted by each
 * cutout's mean alpha — the cheap pixels in a cloud PNG are the transparent
 * ones — the real blend is **29.6% of one viewport**, split:
 *
 *     near  46.30% bbox / 20.84% alpha-weighted   (4 cutouts, 7 copies)
 *     mid   16.97% bbox /  7.47%                  (4 cutouts, 5 copies)
 *     far    3.12% bbox /  1.31%                  (4 cutouts, 4 copies)
 *
 * That is up from 8 painting nodes and 32.66% bbox at six clouds — the node
 * count doubled and the coverage roughly doubled with it, but the total is
 * still under one third of a single full-screen alpha pass, and the twelve
 * decoded bitmaps are shared across all 48 nodes rather than allocated per
 * node. The layer a reduction would take is still `far`: four cutouts worth
 * **1.31%** of one viewport of blending, up from 1.19%. Dropping it still
 * cannot buy a frame. Dropping `near` might — and `near` is the parallax. So
 * the count stands at every width, and the honest reason is that the growth
 * landed on a budget that was never close to spent.
 *
 * (Frame rate itself was not measurable in the verification browser — it runs
 * with `document.hidden`, so `requestAnimationFrame` never fires and motion's
 * loop is frozen. This is a fill-rate and node-count argument, not a profile.)
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The sky band
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Vertical placement keeps every cloud over sky at the start frame. At the
 * pan's starting scale of 3.8 the stage shows image rows 0..f1/3.8 (see
 * PAN_START_SCALE in Hero.tsx), and the first silhouette pixel of the hills
 * is source row 133 of 941 = 0.1413 of the image height, so **the ridgeline
 * breaks the stage at 53.69% of its height** at every aspect at or below the
 * artwork's 16:9, and lower still on wider ones (image row r maps to stage
 * rS/f1, and f1 < 1 only pushes it down). 53.69% is the number the placement
 * is checked against — the shallowest band of any artwork so far (the
 * original painting gave 58.02%).
 *
 * At 1440x900 the lowest cloud edge is **43.64%** of the stage height
 * (cloud-9, mid), clearing the ridgeline by 10.05 points; cloud-8 and cloud-1
 * are next at 43.6% and 43.1%. The binding viewport threshold is cloud-8
 * (near, top 6%, 338px rendered): its bottom stays above the band while the
 * stage is at least 338/(0.5369 - 0.06) = **709 CSS px tall** (up from the
 * 650 the 58.02% band allowed; the vw-scaling regime below 720px wide
 * tightens from a 352px to a ~384px stage the same way). Below that a near
 * cloud starts overlapping the distant hillside — which reads as a low cloud
 * in front of hills, not as an error, so the placement is still left
 * untouched; the hard rule that remains absolute is no cloud over brick.

 * How the horizontal loop is built, and why it cannot seam.
 *
 * A layer's drift track holds `SET_COUNT` identical `CloudSet` tiles, each
 * exactly one stage width `W` wide, tile `k` offset by `translateX(k·100%)` of
 * its own width — so tile `k` occupies track coordinates `[k·W, (k+1)·W)`. The
 * track animates `x` from `-LEAD_SETS·W` to `-(LEAD_SETS + 1)·W`, i.e. the
 * viewport window walks from track span `[LEAD·W, (LEAD+1)·W)` to
 * `[(LEAD+1)·W, (LEAD+2)·W)` — exactly one tile of travel.
 *
 * **Why two tiles was not enough.** The old build was two tiles animating
 * `0% → -50%`, and the note here claimed "the same overlap exists at both ends
 * of the cycle". That is only true when every cloud's box lies inside `[0, W)`
 * of its own tile, which the near layer deliberately breaks in order to get the
 * viewport-edge crop. With clouds hanging out of the tile, the start frame
 * wanted a tile at `-W` to supply cloud-1's tail and the end frame wanted a
 * tile at `+2W` to supply cloud-5's head; neither existed, so a slice of
 * cloud-5 popped in at the right edge and a slice of cloud-1 popped out at the
 * left edge, once every near-layer loop. At the current placement those slices
 * would be 115.2 x 291px and 118.6 x 298px.
 *
 * **Why this construction is exact.** Write the measured overhangs as `oL` and
 * `oR`, so every cloud's box within its own tile is `[p, p + w]` with
 * `-oL·W < p` and `p + w < (1 + oR)·W`. A copy of that cloud exists at
 * `k·W + p` for every `k` in `[0, SET_COUNT)`, and a copy intersects the
 * viewport window `[a·W, (a+1)·W)` exactly when
 *
 *     a - 1 - oR  <  k  <  a + 1 + oL
 *
 * so the copies a window can see are `k ∈ [a - ⌈oR⌉, a + ⌈oL⌉]`. Taking
 * `LEAD_SETS = ⌈oR⌉` and `SET_COUNT = ⌈oR⌉ + ⌈oL⌉ + 2` puts every `k` the start
 * window (`a = LEAD_SETS`) and the end window (`a = LEAD_SETS + 1`) can reach
 * inside `[0, SET_COUNT)` — so every copy either frame needs is mounted. And
 * `k ↦ k + 1` is then a bijection between the copies visible in the start
 * window and those visible in the end window, carrying each to the same screen
 * position, which makes the two frames element-for-element identical. The
 * keyframe jump back to `LOOP_START` swaps two identical frames.
 *
 * With the specs above `oR = 0.4247` and `oL = 0.08`, so `LEAD_SETS = 1` and
 * `SET_COUNT = 4`: a `400%` track animating `-25% → -50%`. Both endpoints are
 * exact quarters of the track, and a percentage translate resolves against the
 * element's own border box, so `-25%` of a `4W` track is exactly `-W`.
 *
 * It is derived, not hardcoded: add a cloud that hangs further out and the
 * track widens to match. If nothing overhangs at all this collapses to the
 * original two-tile `0% → -50%` loop.
 *
 * Easing is `linear`, so velocity is constant across the wrap too — no
 * ease-out/ease-in stutter at the seam.

 * Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` <Hero> pins its pan to the *end* of
 * the animation: scale 1, the whole campus in frame. The clouds have to rest in
 * that same picture, so they cannot simply hold their start-of-animation
 * placement — that was authored against a 3x campus showing only its top third,
 * and dropped onto the 1x campus it lands on hills, treeline and dorm roofs.
 *
 * Two things change, and only for this branch:
 *
 * 1. **Size.** The pan's resting scale is 1 where the animation starts at 3.8,
 *    so the whole scene is roughly a quarter of the size it was. The clouds
 *    follow the same camera: `RESTING_SCALE = 1/3.8`. The pure-sky band above
 *    the ridge is only ~46px tall at 1440x900 once the header has taken its
 *    bite, so at full size the near clouds — 291px to 348px — could not sit
 *    anywhere near it.
 * 2. **Position.** Each cloud is pinned by its *bottom* edge to a percentage of
 *    the stage height, so the edge that matters — the low one — is placed
 *    directly rather than inferred from a `top` plus a height.
 *
 * Where the band is, measured off Campus.png (1672 x 941) rather than
 * guessed: the hill silhouette breaks the horizon at source row 133, i.e.
 * **0.1413** of the image height, and the first brick-coloured pixel of the
 * dormitories is at row 260 (**0.2763**). At scale 1 a stage at or below the
 * artwork's 16:9 — 1440x900 and every portrait screen — is height-constrained
 * (`f1 = 1`) and image fraction `f` lands at stage `f·H`; a wider stage lands
 * it *lower*, at `f·H/f1`. Every `restingBottom` above is >= 82% (bottom edge
 * at or above 0.18·H) — which with this artwork's high ridge means the
 * resting clouds deliberately dip up to 3.87% of the stage *below* the
 * ridgeline on 16:9-and-narrower screens: white puffs in front of pale
 * distant hills, which reads as depth, not as a mistake. The invariant that
 * is actually held is the brick line: every resting cloud clears the first
 * building by at least 9.6% of the stage height (87px at 1440x900).
 *
 * All twelve clouds are placed here, interleaved across the width rather than
 * grouped by layer, so neighbours differ in depth and size: cloud-5, cloud-6,
 * cloud-2, cloud-12, cloud-1, cloud-3, cloud-10, cloud-8, cloud-7, cloud-4,
 * cloud-11, cloud-9. They sum to 78-80% of the stage width, and the placement
 * leaves **no two of them overlapping at all** — measured on the 1425px stage a
 * 1440x900 window actually gives, the tightest gap between neighbours is 18.3px
 * and the widest 27.6px.
 *
 * The heights are `min()` of two terms, and both are needed:
 *
 *   - a percentage of the *stage height*, which is what makes the ridgeline
 *     clearance a ratio that holds at every viewport rather than only at the
 *     reference one;
 *   - a `vw` value equal to that same size at 1440x900, which is what makes the
 *     *horizontal* composition hold. Without it a cloud's width as a fraction
 *     of the stage grows with `H/W`: at 390x844 the boxes would be 3.46x wider
 *     relative to the stage than they are here, the twelve would sum to 271% of
 *     it, and the sky would collapse into one bank. With it they still sum to
 *     78.4%, and the twelve are measurably non-overlapping at 390x844 (gaps
 *     5.3-7.7px) and at 768x1024 (9.2-14.4px) as well as at the reference.
 *
 * The two terms cross exactly at the 1440x900 reference: taller viewports take
 * the `vw` term, wider-and-shorter ones the percentage. Either way the term
 * that wins is the *smaller*, and since these are bottom-pinned, shrinking only
 * moves a cloud's top edge down. The ridgeline clearance is untouched by which
 * term binds.
 *
 * The fixed site header is an opaque `bg-cloud` bar 81px tall (`h-20` + a 1px
 * border; 65px below `sm`) across the top of the stage. The layers are stacked
 * so the far clouds sit clear of it and the four tall near clouds tuck their
 * tops a little way behind it — at 1440x900 the least-visible cloud, cloud-1,
 * still shows 72px of its 99px height below the header.
 *
 * (Widening the viewport only helps: at 2545x1080 (f1 = 0.754) the resting
 * frame shows image rows 0..0.754 and the ridgeline lands at 18.7% of the
 * stage height — past about a 2.26 aspect the ridge drops below the 18%
 * bottom line and even the hill overlap disappears.)

   * The drift is time-linked and infinite, so left alone it keeps animating
   * forever — including long after the scroll-linked fade below has taken the
   * layer to `opacity: 0`, i.e. after it has stopped being anything a reader
   * could see. Past `layer.fadeEnd` the animation is pure cost: frames, battery
   * and a compositor layer, for nothing on screen.
   *
   * So the threshold is exactly this layer's own `fadeEnd`, and that choice is
   * what makes the switch invisible. At `fadeEnd` the layer's opacity is
   * *exactly* zero by the same arithmetic that drives the fade, so both the
   * stop and the restart — which snaps the track back to `LOOP_START` — happen
   * on a frame that paints nothing. A single shared threshold would have paused
   * the near layer while it was still faintly visible; per-layer, it cannot.
   *
   * Scrolling back up past `fadeEnd` sets this true again and the drift
   * resumes, so the pause is a state of the page rather than a one-way latch.
   *
   * The subscription is motion's own `useMotionValueEvent` on the hero's single
   * `useScroll` progress value — there is still no `scroll` listener in `src/`.
   * The handler runs per frame while scrolling but calls `setDrifting` with a
   * boolean that changes at most twice per traversal, and React bails out of a
   * re-render when the state is identical, so a scroll costs one render at the
   * crossing and none either side of it.
   *
   * What this does *not* claim: it is not an in-page pause control, and 2.2.2's
   * strictest reading wants one. The page's answer to that is
   * `prefers-reduced-motion` (below), which removes the drift entirely; this
   * bounds the animation so it stops on its own instead of running for the rest
   * of the session behind content the reader has already scrolled to.
   *
   * The same flag also gates this layer's `will-change` below (P5-7): past
   * `fadeEnd` neither the drift nor the scroll-linked `y`/`opacity` moves, so
   * the hint has nothing left to buy. `fadeEnd` is the right threshold for both
   * for the same reason — the layer's opacity is exactly 0 there, so the
   * de-promotion, like the pause, lands on a frame that paints nothing.
