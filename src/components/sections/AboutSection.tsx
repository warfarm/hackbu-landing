/**
 * "About us" — the page's masthead: mission, Discord and mailing-list CTAs.
 *
 * This copy used to sit inside the hero, over the illustration. It measured
 * 1.43:1 there and the only wash that fixed it covered most of the frame, so it
 * was moved here instead: the hero stays pure illustration and the words land
 * on cloud, where `text-pine` is 6.83:1 and `text-pine/90` is 5.36:1.
 *
 * It carries the page's only <h1>, and it is the first heading in the document,
 * so the outline is h1 -> the three section h2s with no skipped level. That is
 * why the markup below is written out rather than reusing <SectionHeader>,
 * which is hard-wired to <h2>. The type and measure still match it
 * (`Eyebrow`, `text-display-lg`, `max-w-2xl`, lede at `mt-5`).
 *
 * The two CTAs use the same card chrome and two-column grid as the rest of the
 * page's paired blocks. `size="md"` keeps them smaller than the get-involved
 * card's Discord button (`size="lg"` plus `sm:px-10 sm:py-5`).
 *
 * **Reveal.** Header is a standard <Reveal>; the two cards are a RevealGroup.
 * That is safe even though this is the first content block: the hero's track
 * is 260dvh (one viewport under reduced motion, where <Reveal> drops its
 * motion props entirely), so this block is never within the viewport at mount.
