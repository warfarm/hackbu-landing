/**
 * How wide the illustration is actually *drawn*, which is not the width of its

 * the drawn content is:
 *
 *   viewport aspect >= 1672/941 (16:9)  ->  width-constrained, content
 *                                           width = 100vw
 *   viewport aspect <  1672/941         ->  height-constrained, content width
 *                                           = 100vh x 1672/941 = 177.68vh
 *
 * (The artwork is 16:9, so laptops like 1440x900 and every portrait screen
 * sit in the vh branch; only screens wider than 16:9 take `vw`.)
 *
 * The image is fetched while the hero sits at its start frame, where the pan
 * has the content magnified by PAN_START_SCALE = 3.8 (see Hero.tsx) — so both
 * regimes are written here multiplied by 3.8: `380vw`, and
 * `380vh x 1672/941 = 675.20vh`. `sizes` has no way to see a transform, so the
 * factor is baked into the expression; it is exactly what lets a desktop reach
 * the upscaled rungs — quoting the unmagnified width would leave the browser
 * three rungs down, on the blur the ladder exists to fix. **Keep this factor
 * equal to PAN_START_SCALE** — the two moved together when the scale rose
 * from 3 for the current artwork's shorter sky.
 *
 * The two leading `1114px` entries cap small TOUCH screens out of the heavy
 * top rungs. On a phone, `object-cover` discards most of the drawn width (see
 * CAMPUS_OBJECT_POSITION in Hero.tsx), so a 1-2 MB rung's bytes would be
 * mostly cropped off screen; 1114px quotes a slot that lands DPR-2 phones on
 * the 2508 rung and DPR-3 phones on 3344 (1114 x 3 = 3342 <= 3344). The
 * `max-height` entry is the same cap for landscape phones, which a width test
 * alone misses. Both are gated on `(pointer: coarse)` because the dimension
 * tests alone also catch small *desktop* windows — a 455px-tall embedded
 * pane was measured taking the landscape-phone cap and rendering the start
 * frame from a low rung stretched 2x. A desktop window is DPR-1-or-2 and
 * resizable upward, so it always reads the honest magnified size below, and
 * desktops take the top of the ladder. (A browser that cannot evaluate
 * `pointer` treats the condition as false and falls through to the honest
 * entries — the failure mode is extra bytes, never extra blur.)
 *
 * Must match `imagesizes` on the preload link in index.html, or the preload
 * fetches a different rung than `<picture>` asks for and the image loads twice.
