                The header is <b>position: fixed</b>. This frame carries a
                transform, which makes it the containing block for fixed
                descendants — so the bar pins to the top of the frame instead of
                to the sheet’s viewport. On the real page it pins to the
                viewport and content scrolls under it, as this filler copy is
                doing.

            <b>aria-expanded</b>, and the lockup’s <b>aria-label</b> is what
            gives the home link its accessible name — the marks are empty
