/**
 * Build-time image derivative generator — `npm run images`.
 *
 * Reads the deployable PNGs under `public/artwork/` and writes AVIF + WebP
 * derivatives beside them. The originals in `artwork/` are never touched, and
 * the PNGs in `public/artwork/` stay in place as the final <picture> fallback.
 *
 * This runs by hand, not on every build: the outputs are committed, so a
 * deploy needs nothing but `npm run build` (lint, `tsc -b`, `vite build`, then
 * the prerender step) — never this script. `sharp` is therefore a devDependency
 * and never reaches the browser bundle.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Widths
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Campus.png is 1672 x 941, and the hero magnifies the illustration up to
 * 3.8x — so at the start frame every screen wants far more pixels than the
 * source has, and a ladder capped at the intrinsic width rendered visibly
 * soft. The rungs above 1672 are therefore cut from
 * `artwork/campus/Campus-upscaled-6688.webp` (lossless), the raw 4x
 * Real-ESRGAN (`realesrgan-x4plus`) enlargement of the illustration; the
 * rungs at and below 1672 still come from the true source, where no
 * interpolation is involved at all. **6688 is the ceiling** — the enlarger's
 * own 4x output, inspected at 1:1 before shipping. At 4x the model is drawing
 * plausible detail rather than recovering real pixels, but the artwork's flat
 * cel-shaded style survives that almost perfectly, and the honest alternative
 * (a soft campus) reads as a defect at 3.8x.
 *
 * (The hero used to layer twelve cloud cutouts over the sky, encoded here from
 * `public/artwork/clouds/`. That layer was removed; the originals stay in
 * `artwork/clouds/` as read-only reference and nothing copies them into
 * `public/`, so this script never sees them.)
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Quality
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Measured on the full-width campus tier (PSNR against the source PNG):
 *
 *     AVIF q60 237 KB 34.25 dB   q65 267 KB 35.15 dB   q70 324 KB 36.63 dB
 *     WebP q80 318 KB 33.49 dB   q85 385 KB 34.59 dB   q90 499 KB 36.23 dB
 *
 * AVIF q68 / WebP q82 sit just below the knee of both curves. The campus image
 * is the LCP element and is displayed upscaled, where compression artifacts are
 * magnified along with everything else, so this leans toward quality — it is
 * still ~9x smaller than the 2.81 MB PNG and leaves most of the 1.5 MB
 * first-load image budget unspent.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Brand marks
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The second half of this script reads `brand-source/` — also read-only — and
 * writes `public/brand/`. Two kinds of output come out of it:
 *
 * 1. **Mask derivatives** for the bearcat and the wordmark. The two source
 *    marks are drawn in two different greens (#339966 and #42B872), neither of
 *    which was a palette token. Rather than recolour the pixels, the page
 *    paints an element in the `fern` token and takes the mark's *shape* from
 *    the PNG's alpha via `mask-image` (see `.brand-mark-*` in src/index.css).
 *    So the only channel these files need to carry is alpha: RGB is flattened
 *    to white before encoding, which `mask-image` never reads and which makes
 *    the PNGs compress to a few KB each.
 *
 *    They are also *small*. The header mark is ~36 CSS px tall, so the ladder
 *    is a 1x rung sized against the largest place the mark is drawn plus a 2x
 *    rung for high-DPR screens — not the multi-megabyte originals.
 *
 *    Both sources are trimmed to their ink first, so `mask-size: contain` maps
 *    the drawn mark onto the element box exactly and the aspect ratios the app
 *    declares are the ink's, not the canvas's.
 *
 * 2. **App icons.** `favicon-{32,64}.png` are the bearcat, trimmed and squared
 *    on transparency. `apple-touch-icon.png` and `og-image.png` are
 *    `icon_discord.png`, which is already a finished app tile — re-encoded,
 *    because the source is a 2.15 MB PNG of a 14-colour image.
