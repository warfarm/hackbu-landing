/**
 * Build-time prerender — the last step of `npm run build`.
 *
 * `vite build` writes seven HTML files whose entire body is `<div id="root">`,
 * so nothing paints until ~100 KB gzip of JavaScript has downloaded, parsed and
 * executed, and the LCP element — the campus illustration — does not exist in
 * the HTML response at all (P5-1, and P5-8 with it: the twelve cloud cutouts
 * above the fold are undiscoverable for the same reason). This script renders
 * every page to a string and writes that string into the root div, so the
 * markup ships with the document and the client hydrates it instead of building
 * it from nothing.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this shape
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The renders happen in a Vite dev server in `middlewareMode` — created, used
 * and closed inside this process, never listening on a port — because that is
 * the one way to run `src/entry-server.tsx` with the project's own transform
 * pipeline and no second build output. The alternative, `vite build --ssr`,
 * would emit a server bundle that has to be written somewhere, kept out of
 * `dist/` (Vercel deploys `dist/` verbatim), kept out of git, and cleaned up.
 * Nothing here writes a file except the six HTML files it rewrites.
 *
 * It rewrites the *built* HTML rather than the source template, so everything
 * `vite build` put in the head survives untouched: the hashed script and
 * stylesheet links, the `%SITE_ORIGIN%` substitution from vite.config.ts's
 * `siteOrigin` plugin, the LCP `<link rel="preload" as="image">`, and the three
 * font preloads its `fontPreload` plugin emits. The replacement is the root div
 * and nothing else — no tag is added to the head from here, so the prerendered
 * `<picture>` in the body does not duplicate or contradict the image preload
 * already declared above it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What it does not do
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * There is no data fetching, no router and no per-request state: all seven pages
 * are the same for every visitor, which is what makes a build-time render
 * enough. Nothing from this file, from `src/entry-server.tsx`, or from
 * `react-dom/server` reaches the browser bundle — no HTML entry imports
 * them, so they are not in the client module graph.
