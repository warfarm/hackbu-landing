 * The deployed origin, for the absolute URLs in the public pages' social
 * preview (`index.html`'s `og:url` and `og:image`, and the `og:image` on
 * `about|schedule|sponsors|hackathons|organizers.html` — scrapers do not resolve a
 * relative one).
 *
 * Vercel sets `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` on every build to the project's
 * production hostname with no scheme (`hackbu-landing.vercel.app`, and the
 * custom domain once one is attached), so the origin is that plus `https://`.
 * Anywhere else — a local build, `vite dev` — the variable is absent and the
 * fallback below applies, which is the literal that used to be hardcoded in
 * `index.html`. So a local `dist/index.html` is unchanged from before, and a
 * domain move needs no edit to any HTML file.
 *
 * Why a plugin rather than Vite's built-in `%KEY%` interpolation: that hook
 * substitutes only keys present in `config.env`, i.e. `.env` variables carrying
 * the `envPrefix` (`VITE_`) plus the handful of `import.meta.env` built-ins. A
 * bare `process.env` name is not among them — an unknown `%KEY%` is returned
 * untouched — so `%VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL%` in the HTML would ship to
 * production verbatim. Widening `envPrefix` to reach it would also expose every
 * other matching variable to client code, which is the thing the prefix exists
 * to prevent.
 *
 * `process.env` is read directly and one key by name; `loadEnv` is not used, so
 * no `.env.local` is parsed and nothing else can leak into the page.

/**
 * The three self-hosted faces, by the base name `@fontsource` gives them, in
 * the order they are preloaded. `src/index.css` declares one `@font-face` per
 * entry here and Vite emits each as a content-hashed asset — so the hashes are
 * read back out of the bundle below rather than written down anywhere.
 *
 * All three, not just the two above the fold. Fraunces is display-only and the
 * hero carries no type, so the earlier reading was that preloading it would
 * compete with the LCP image for bandwidth; against that, `<AboutSection>`'s
 * <h1> is the first thing under the hero and is set in it, `font-display: swap`
 * means a late face is a reflow rather than a delay, and 18 KB is small next to
 * the 495 KB of imagery the same connection is already carrying. Preloading the
 * set the page actually uses is the simpler contract, and it is the whole set:
 * Fraunces 600, Inter 400, Inter 500 and nothing else.

/**
 * `<link rel="preload" as="font">` for those three, on every public page.
 *
 * Without it the faces cannot be requested until the stylesheet has arrived
 * *and* style resolution has found an element using each family — which is late,
 * and above-the-fold text on this page is Inter (the header's nav links are
 * Inter 500, body copy is Inter 400). The preload starts them alongside the
 * stylesheet instead. See P5-5.
 *
 * The filenames are content-hashed, so they cannot be written by hand. `order:
 * 'post'` runs this after Vite has emitted the bundle, which is what makes
 * `ctx.bundle` available to look them up in; in dev `ctx.bundle` is undefined
 * and the hook is a no-op, which is correct — the dev server serves the faces
 * unhashed straight out of `node_modules` and there is nothing to preload.
 *
 * `crossorigin` is not optional here even though the fonts are same-origin:
 * fonts are always fetched in CORS mode, and a preload whose mode does not
 * match the later fetch is a second download rather than a warm cache.
 *
 * The tags are written in before the stylesheet link rather than appended to
 * the end of the head, so the three font requests are queued ahead of the
 * request that would otherwise have to complete before they could start.
 *
 * Every entry but `components.html`. The six public pages all set their body
 * copy in Inter 400/500 above the fold and their headings in Fraunces 600, and
 * each is a plausible cold first visit — an inbound link to `/about` or
 * `/schedule` has exactly the same problem `index.html` had. The component
 * sheet is excluded because it is internal, is `noindex`, and is never a cold
 * first visit that matters. The three faces are the same three assets on every
 * page, so the hints cost nothing beyond the six head tags themselves.

/**
 * Names the two chunks the pages share, instead of letting Rollup name them
 * after whichever module happens to be their facade (P1-1).
 *
 * Left alone, Rollup hoisted React, `motion` *and* every shared component into
 * one 283 KB chunk and called it `SiteFooter-*.js`, after a 72-line footer.
 * The behaviour was right and the name was a trap for anyone reading a build
 * log or a performance trace. Two deliberate names instead:
 *
 *   vendor  everything from node_modules — react, react-dom, scheduler,
 *           react/jsx-runtime, motion and its motion-dom / motion-utils
 *           internals. Third-party code, versioned by package.json, changing
 *           only when a dependency does.
 *   shared  `src/components/**` and `src/lib/**` — the component tree and the
 *           three lib modules — minus the per-page section directories named
 *           below. This is the set every entry imports: the sheet renders the
 *           real components, the landing page's sections included
 *           (`src/sheet/parts/ComposedPart.tsx`), so nothing landing-only is
 *           being pushed into the sheet's download by naming it this way.
 *
 * `src/components/sections/schedule/` and `src/components/sections/hackathons/`
 * are the exception, and they are why `SECTIONS_ONE_PAGE` exists. They sit
 * under `src/components/` by the merge's filing convention, but each directory
 * is rendered by exactly one page — `ScheduleApp` and `HackathonsApp` — and a
 * module in `shared` is downloaded by *every* page, so the plain rule put the
 * schedule's calendar copy and the hackathon's registration copy into the
 * landing page's critical path. Excluded here, they fall into their own page's
 * entry chunk instead, where the same bytes are paid for once by the one page
 * that renders them. (`src/components/sections/` itself stays in `shared`: the
 * landing sections really are rendered by two entries.)
 *
 * Nothing under `src/sheet/` matches either rule, so the sheet's own code stays
 * in the `components` entry chunk and out of the landing page, exactly as
 * before. CSS is left to Vite: assigning stylesheets a JS chunk would take
 * Vite's stylesheet handling out of the loop for no gain.
